WhdeMacBookPro:Alert whde$ pod trunk push Alert

[!] No podspec found in directory `Alert`
[!] You need to register a session first.

Usage:

    $ pod trunk push [PATH]

      Publish the podspec at `PATH` to make it available to all users of the
      ‘master’ spec-repo. If `PATH` is not provided, defaults to the current
      directory.

      Before pushing the podspec to cocoapods.org, this will perform a local
      lint of the podspec, including a build of the library. However, it remains
      *your* responsibility to ensure that the published podspec will actually
      work for your users. Thus it is recommended that you *first* try to use
      the podspec to integrate the library into your demo and/or real
      application.

      If this is the first time you publish a spec for this pod, you will
      automatically be registered as the ‘owner’ of this pod. (Note that ‘owner’
      in this case implies a person that is allowed to publish new versions and
      add other ‘owners’, not necessarily the library author.)

Options:

    --allow-warnings   Allows push even if there are lint warnings
    --use-libraries    Linter uses static libraries to install the spec
    --silent           Show nothing
    --verbose          Show more debugging information
